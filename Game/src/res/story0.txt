Quadro liked it in the clouds, they were his home. But one 
stormy day, he fell all the way down from the sky into the 
sewer. It was depressing for poor little Quadro, separated 
from his family and friends. 
He has only one goal, he wants to go back home...but on his 
way there are many dangers, such as dirty water and insects. 
In order to eliminate them, Quadro has to jump on them. 
Will you be able to help little Quadro getting back to his
family and friends in the sky?
