Quadro liked it in the clouds, it was his home. But one stormy day,
he fell all the way down from the sky into the sewer. It was 
depressing for poor little Quadro, separated from his family and
friends. He wanted to go back home...but on his way there were many
dangers, such as dirty water. 
Quadro was afraid of touching it, because he wanted to stay clean to
get back to the clouds.
Will you be able to help little Quadro getting back to his family and
friends in the sky?
